# Quantum simulation
## This project contains the codes of quantum simulations of 1D & 2D periodically driven spin systems on quantum computers
### all the simulation codes can be categorized into 3 types. The code running on quantum virtual machine (qvm), wavefunction simulator, and real quantum computer. The codes running on qvm and real quantum computers will be roughly the same,except for the virtural qubits or real qubits it accquires.
